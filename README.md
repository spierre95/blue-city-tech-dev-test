## Summary 

### challenges

One of the major challenges I faced was the time constraint. I was unable to finish each section in the allotted time. This is partly due to unexpected challenges but also personal and professional responsibilities that took priority over the test, which further diminished the time I had to complete the test.  

Secondly, mapping the data to the correct format required for the JavaScript library took some time as well, this is something I did not anticipate and cost valuable time 

### next steps

If I had more time, I would definitely attempt to finish each section first, then I would take the time to improve the UX/UI.
